C Hash Table
=============
Toy implementation of a hash table in C. My second implementation of
a hash table, this time using a probe table as well as being a
single header file.

Make sure to define the following before using:

#define HTABLE_KEY_EQ {compare function between two keys}
#define HTABLE_KEY_TYPE {key type}
#define HTABLE_VALUE_TYPE {value type}
#define HTABLE_HASH_FUNCTION {hash function for key type}
#define HTABLE_ELEM_DELETE {destructor for key and value}

Check out tests for examples.

Requirements
------------
In order to build you need GNU make.
